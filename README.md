# Shader examples with Processing

## Description

This is an applicaton that allows you to apply and modify different parameters to change the appearance of a figure using fragment and vertex shaders.

## How it works

In order to use the application you just have to run the main file. It will show you the title screen where you can start the application:

* Press 'enter' to start the application from the title screen.
* Press 'H' to show the help information.
* Use the mouse cursor to rotate de figure.
* Use the mouse wheel to increase or decrease the light intensity.
* Use up and down arrow keys to increase or decrease the resolution of the texture.

## Implementation decisions

This application has been developed according to the principles of Jakob Nielsen. It is easy to use, makes the user feels the control at every moment and uses a minimalist and simple design. It is not possible for the user to generate any programming error so it has not been necessary to control the user's movements. The controls are at hand at the beginning of the application in the title screeen so it is not possible for the user to get lost using the application.
